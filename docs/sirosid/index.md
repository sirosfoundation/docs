# SIROS ID Platform

Via the SIROS ID platform you can manage one or more digital identity credential manager services and connect them to issuers, verifiers and trust services. Users gain access to your credential manager service either by using the SIROS ID web application at <a href="https://app.siros.org">app.siros.org</a> or by using one of the SIROS native apps.

Here you will find all the information you need in order to manage, observe and integrate with your digital credantial manager. 

The SIROS ID platform consists of the followin parts:

* [SIROS ID Credential Manager](./cm.md)  built on the [wwWallet](../wwwallet/index.md) project
* [SIROS ID Issuer and Verifier](./integrations/index.md) built on https://github.com/dc4eu/vc
* [SIROS ID Trust Services](./integrations/trust.md)

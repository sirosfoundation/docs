# SIROS ID Roadmap

We are working around the clock to turn SIROS ID into a feature-complete solution for digital identity credentials. Currently we are working on adding support for things like...

* Zero knowledge proof technology - in the isuser, verifier and CM alike
* The W3C digital credentials API
* The EU Business Wallet (EUBW)
* Whitelabeling and user-configurable UX

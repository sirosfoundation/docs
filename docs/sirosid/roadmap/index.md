# SIROS ID Roadmap

We are working around the clock to turn SIROS ID into a feature-complete solution for digital identity credentials. Currently we are working on adding support for things like...

* Zero knowledge proof technology - in the isuser, verifier and CM alike
* The W3C digital credentials API
* Compliance with the EU Business Wallet (EUBW) specification as it evolves
* Whitelabeling and user-configurable UX
* Certification as an EUID wallet

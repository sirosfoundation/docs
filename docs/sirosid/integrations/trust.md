# Trust Services

A digital credential service consisting of issuers, credential managers and verifiers need some mechanism of recognizing each other. This is called technical trust management and can be established in several different ways. SIROS ID currently supports the following trust mechanisms in our credential managers and recommended issuers and verifiers:

* [ETSI TSL 119 612](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119600_119699/119612/02.04.01_60/ts_119612v020401p.pdf) (aka ETSI trust status lists)
* [OpenID Federation](https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html)
* [DID:web](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/)

Other mechanisms including other DID methods can be implemented. Contact us with your requests!

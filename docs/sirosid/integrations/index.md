# Integrations

A SIROS ID Credential Manager Service comes with a set of demo issuers and verifiers that can be used for development and debugging.

For production-grade configuration, refer to the guides in this section. SIROS ID tries to maintain compatibility with most major issuers and verifiers. If possible, we recommend that you use https://github.com/dc4eu/vc as a starting point for building a production environment. Our own hosted issuer and verifiers are all based on this software stack.
